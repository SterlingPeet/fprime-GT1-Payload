This test case builds a passive component called Passive with a single input
and output port to demonstrate the code generation of a passive component
with only typed ports.

In the future this will be automated.

1. Execute ../../bin/yacgen.py PassiveComponentAi.xml
2. Execute ../../bin/yacgen.py TypedInterfaceAi.xml
3. Execute scons
4. Execute ./Top

It should work.
