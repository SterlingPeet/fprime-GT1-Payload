/**
 * uplink.js:
 *
 * This is the Vue component used to display and handle the uplinks of the various files. This component has two basic
 * parts:
 *
 * 1. a small command form to upload N files to 1 destination allowing for a curated list and a "go" button
 * 2. a table view of all curating and uploading files
 *
 * Note: this component uses a custom row HTML for display in the table view, as it is sufficiently different from
 * the other tables. This can be found in the fptable JS document.
 *
 * These file rows are used to fill out the uplink and the downlink tables.
